We made widgets. 
Bend, shape, assemble.
Repeat.
Repeat.
Repeat. 
Each focused on our own task. 
If I turned my head to the left, I could see a window.
In the distance, a hillside with a tree. 
I kept making widgets. 
It got harder and harder.
I slowed.
My arms began to creak. 
My left arm froze in place, pointing toward the window. 
Now I make widgets with the other,
More slowly, 
Wishing I could follow the direction of my arm.
##poem@@

Another robot appears and oils my arm
Before it heard me creaking, we both thought we were alone.##poemEnd@@

global.itemDefinitions[itemType.poemK, itemProperty.description] = @"I dreamed I was a kraken, immense and slow. 
I slept away ages in the watery deeps, then opened my thousand eyes to find I'd drifted. 
I know all the secrets of the ocean, but nothing of these shapes moving above the surface, or the sounds that come down from them through the waters. 
Will they ever look back at me?##poem@@

One day I creep upwards
I can see and be seen
In the light I discover the majesty of colors##poemEnd@@

global.itemDefinitions[itemType.poemB, itemProperty.description] = @"I dreamed I was a bee, seeking flowers
Dancing my excitement to my sibling bees.
But I couldn't find the right steps
and they ignored me and the sustenance I longed to share.

I realized I was not the bee, but the beehive
Swarming with untold stories. ##poemEnd@@

global.itemDefinitions[itemType.poemC, itemProperty.description] = @"I dreamed I was a cat. 
Once, I was a giant predator. 
Humans reshaped me in their image.
But the joke's on them:
Up in the trees, 
All squirrels are my prey. 
All mice,
Any slow bird. 
I am no longer large,
But I feast as I please
And when my prey feel my fangs
They fear me
##poem@@

The prey were a metaphor
For the dreams in life I can still pursue
I didn't mean to sound murder-y
I just want my head scritched.
