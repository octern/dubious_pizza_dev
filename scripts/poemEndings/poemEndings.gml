We made widgets. 
Bend, shape, assemble.
Repeat.
Repeat.
Repeat. 
Each focused on our own task. 
If I turned my head to the right, I could see a window.
In the distance, a hillside with a tree. 
I kept making widgets. 
It got harder and harder.
I slowed.
My arms began to creak. 
My right arm froze in place, pointing toward the window. 
Now I make widgets with the other,
More slowly, 
Wishing I could follow the direction of my arm.
##poem@@

Another robot appears and oils my arm
Before it heard me creaking, we both thought we were alone.##poemEnd@@";


global.itemDefinitions[itemType.poemK, itemProperty.description] = @"I dreamed I was a kraken, immense and slow. 
I slept away ages in the watery deeps, then opened my thousand eyes to find I'd drifted. 
I know all the secrets of the ocean, but nothing of these shapes moving above me, or the sounds that come down from them through the waters. 
Will they ever look back at me?##poem@@

One day I creep upwards
I can see and be seen
In the light I discover the majesty of colors##poemEnd@@";

global.itemDefinitions[itemType.poemB, itemProperty.description] = @"I dreamed I was a bee, seeking flowers
Dancing my excitement to my sibling bees.
But I couldn't find the right steps
and they ignored me and the sustenance I longed to share.

OI realized I was not the bee, but the beehive
Swarming with untold stories. ##poemEnd@@";


global.itemDefinitions[itemType.poemC, itemProperty.description] = @"I dreamed I was a cat. 
Once, I was a giant predator. 
Humans reshaped me in their image.
But the joke's on them:
I climb up trees.
All squirrels are my prey. 
On the ground,
All mice,
Any downed bird. 
Perhaps I am no longer large,
But all my prey know me when they see me coming. 
##poem@@

My humans are the best prey:
From them, I extract
Cooked salmon 
And head scritches.
