#poem#I dreamed I was a robot, at work in a factory full of robots.
We made widgets. 
Bend, shape, assemble.
Repeat.
Repeat.
Repeat. 
Each focused on our own task. 
If I turned my head to the right, I could see a window.
In the distance, a hillside with a tree. 
I kept making widgets. 
It got harder and harder.
I slowed.
My arms began to creak. 
My right arm froze in place, pointing toward the window. 
Now I make widgets with the other,
More slowly, 
Wishing I could follow the direction of my arm.

It sounds like my friend has been needing help. Should I have been listening better?";

I slept away ages in the watery deeps, then opened my thousand eyes to find I'd drifted. 
I know all the secrets of the ocean, but nothing of these shapes moving above me, or the sounds that come down from them through the waters. 
Will they ever look back at me?
#desc#-----
Now I feel guilty about not staying in touch more. It sounds like my friend's really been feeling isolated.";

global.itemDefinitions[itemType.poemB, itemProperty.description] = @"#poem#I dreamed I was a bee, seeking flowers
Dancing my excitement to my sibling bees.
But I couldn't find the right steps
and they ignored me and the sustenance I longed to share.

I always felt like I understood my friend. It sounds like they didn't think anyone ever did.";

global.itemDefinitions[itemType.poemC, itemProperty.description] = @"#poem#I dreamed I was a cat. 
Once, I was a giant predator. 
Humans reshaped me in their image.
But the joke's on them:
I climb up trees.
All squirrels are my prey. 
On the ground,
All mice,
Any downed bird. 
Perhaps I am no longer large,
But all my prey know me when they see me coming. 
#desc#-----
...I don't think my friend has ever had a cat. 
Also, this is the kind of thing we sometimes hear from people who want to become vampires for the wrong reasons. ";
